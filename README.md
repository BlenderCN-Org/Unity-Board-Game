Unity Board Game is currently a prototype board game constructed within the Unity3D Game engine. It is being developed privately at the moment but I am welcome to any and all improvements or pull requests. If you are interested in viewing the source, please do not hesitate to clone the master branch as that is the most up-to-date iteration. For a comprehensive list of issues and improvements currently in the pipeline, please see the backlog linked below.
